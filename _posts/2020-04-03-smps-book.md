The book sums up nearly 10 years of my professional experience as a technician across various companies. It covers the general operating principles of different types of power supplies and provides an introduction to troubleshooting and repair.

The book is primarily aimed at people with basic electronics knowledge who are beginning a career as service technicians, as well as those already working in the field but lacking theoretical background.

It addresses the following aspects:

- basic electronic components, their types, differences, and most important characteristics;
- fundamental circuit blocks (dividers, rectifiers, linear regulators, etc.);
- an overview of SMPS topologies and power factor correction units;
- an overview of consumer SMPS devices (PC power supplies, UPSs, welding machines);
- snubbers and EMI filters, as well as digital circuitry protection;
- commonly used SMPS-specific ICs;
- practical advice on diagnostics and repair;
- a note on counterfeit components.

All materials are accompanied by schematic fragments of up-to-date, commercially available devices to bring the content as close to real-world practice as possible.
