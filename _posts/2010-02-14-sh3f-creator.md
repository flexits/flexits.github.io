Converts 3DS, OBJ and LWS models into furniture libraries for [Sweet Home 3D](https://www.sweethome3d.com/) interior design application.
This is one of my first programs ever, and by chance, it wasn’t lost since 2010!

I created this while being jus a newbie learner and knew next to nothing of object-oriented programming, code style, or else. The code looks weird in places, there’s no consistent naming style... but it worked (and not just for me!) and, at the time, I was thrilled to share this app with the world. So, I let it rest here as a precious memory.

## Technical

*Windows Forms* and *Visual Studio*, *[SharpZipLib](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib)* for packing data.
